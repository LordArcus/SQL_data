Insights:

We have 96096 customers where 3.11% customer purchase multiple times but
only 0.26% customers (loyal) purchase more than 2 times


Objective:
1. find the problem why 96.81% customer didn't purchase
2. find why we have loyal customer
3. Increase percentage of loyal customer


So i compared between customers that order one time with customers that ordered mulitple time interms of order status and found that
There's nothing specific but
mulitple purchase customers cancelled rate: 1.5%
one time purchase customers cancelled rate: 0.6%

This may be due to 0.7% unavailable rate which is 0.1% higher than unavailable rate of one time purchase customer.



Also, checked repeated rate by products 

this helps to increase loyal customer 


From this we could find repeat_rate_per_categroy and analysis this as:
less percentage <- need attention, make bundle with high percentage 
high percentage <- We can increase budget on this and also make discount so that we could increase mulitple purchase
